        Initialize a Gallery of Maps.

        The default will display a set of Panels in one
        row or column. For building more complicated
        galleries of panels you might want to start
        from here and overwrite two methods:
        - `setup_panels()` to connect panels to axes
        - `refine_panels()` to fuss with details

        Parameters
        ----------
        panels : dict, list
            A dictionary or list of Panels that should be
            included in this Gallery. If Panels are not
            specified here, they must be defined inside of
            `.setup_panels()`.
        label : str, None
            A string to label this Gallery, which will
            mostly appear in filenames for saved plots.
        **kw : dict
            All additional keywords will be passed to
            `.setup_panels()` to decide how the subplots
