        Initialize a Plottable quantity.

        This `Plottable` serves as a helper for plotting
        `exoatlas` quantities. It provides functions to
        return values and uncertainties for a `Population`,
        but it also stores important information about
        labels, scales, and limits that are needed for
        good automatic visualizations (but are not needed
        for simply doing calculations).

        Often a `Plottable` will be connected to some kind
        of a visualization `Panel`, which will handle rendering
        data on plots and cycling through populations.

        Parameters
        ----------
        source : str
            Generally a string, indicating a
            retrievable population attribute,
            which will be used as the value
            to plot. The values-getting can
            also be over-written by defining
            a .value() method, if the desired
            values are more complicated than
            a simple attribute/property (e.g.
            if it depends on an input, like
            wavelength).
        label : str
            Human-friendly string describing
            this axis, which will appear as
            its label in the plot.
        scale : str
            String ('linear', 'log', ?) to
            indicate what scale should be
            used for this axis.
        lim : tuple
            Tuple to indicate (lower, upper)
            limits for the plot. These might
            also be used to set the vmin and
            vmax of a color map, if this
            plottable is being used to color
            points in a BubblePanel. `lim`
            should have no units attached.
            For compariing different populations,
            it's probably a very good idea to
            explicitly set the limits and not
            leave them as None; otherwise
            individual populations might normalize
            themselves separately.
        unit : astropy.units.Unit
            The astropy unit to be used for plotting.
            It must be something to which the
            quantity can be converted.
        kw : dict
            All other keywords will be passed to .get()
            when retrieving values or uncertainties.
            For example, for source='teq', we might
            consider passing 'albedo' or 'f' keywords,
            to therefore get the values and uncertainties
            associated with a particular parameters.
