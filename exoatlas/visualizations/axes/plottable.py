    """
    General class definition for a plottable axis,
    which can appear as either an xaxis or yaxis.

    The standard items to include in the definition
    of a plottable object are:

        source = Generally a string, indicating a
                 retrievable population attribute,
                 which will be used as the value
                 to plot. The values-getting can
                 also be over-written by defining
                 a .value() method, if the desired
                 values are more complicated than
                 a simple attribute/property (e.g.
                 if it depends on an input, like
                 wavelength).

        label  = Human-friendly string describing
                 this axis, which will appear as
                 its label in the plot.

        scale  = String ('linear', 'log', ?) to
                 indicate what scale should be
                 used for this axis.

        lim    = Tuple to indicate (lower, upper)
                 limits for the plot. These might
                 also be used to set the vmin and
                 vmax of a color map, if this
                 plottable is being used to color
                 points in a BubblePanel.

        size_normalization = (optional) What to multiply
                 the values by to convert them
                 into sizes for a scatter plot.

        Extract the values for this plottable axis.

        This extracts values for population that's
        currently in focus for a plotting panel. 
        Generally, plotting panels might loop 
        through multiple populations to include
        each on the plot.

    Make sure the axis initializer is a Plottable class.

    We allow fairly flexible calls to plotting panels,
    where it's possible that a Plottable might be 
    requested using a variety of different formats. 
    This wrapper tries to make sure we get to what we 
    need, a class definition, no matter what.

    Parameters
    ----------
    initial : Plottable, Plottable class, str, None
        One of a few ways to flexibly define a Plottable.
        Here's how the different options will be interpreted:

        Plottable = 
            If already an instance, the Plottable object itself 
            will be used for plotting. This would be common for 
            something like `StellarBrightness(wavelength=5*u.micron)`,
            where keywords are necessary for what's being plotted.
        Plottable class = 
            If a class definition, the Plottable will be 
            created using the defaults for that class. 
        str = 
            If a string, a Plottable will be created using 
            the method with that name from the populations. 
            Keywords should (CHECKME?!?!!?) still work, 
            but it will be more difficult to set bespoke 
            axis labels and/or plotting defaults. 
        None = 
            The parent panel probably has a Plottable 
            connected to a particular axis; None just means
            not to overwrite that default. 
    Returns
    -------
    plottable : (various)
        Either a Plottable, or something that can be interpreted 
        to create plottable when assigned data to plot in 
        a visualization Panel.
