# exoplanet_atlas

The `exoplanet_atlas` package is a set of tools for interacting with exoplanet populations. It contains a friendly way to download useful data from online archives like the NASA Exoplanet Archive, tools for easy access planet properties, and some pre-packaged visualizations for summarizing and comparing different populations.
