This is a very crude overview, designed mostly to help with weird nitty gritty internal decision making for the `exoatlas`. We include these in the documentation because it's useful to see these plots generated regularly as the Exoplanet Archive grows, but we hide it away at the end because we don't explain things particularly well (yet?).*"

An easy way to remove those theoretical estimates, is to eliminate values that don't have finite uncertainties associated with them. All measurements should have uncertainties!
