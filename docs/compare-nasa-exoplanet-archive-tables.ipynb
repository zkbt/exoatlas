    "*Here, we explore some visualizations of how the Planetary Systems (one row per reference) and Planetary Systems Composite (one row per planet) tables compare to one another, and how the data within those tables fits together. The plots here are designed mostly to help with weird nitty gritty internal decision making for the `exoatlas`. These plots are made with love and should not be seen as criticisms of the NASA Exoplanet Archive; the fine folks there do a herculean task to wrangle data from thousands of different papers.*\n",

An easy way to remove those theoretical estimates, is to eliminate values that don't have finite uncertainties associated with them. All measurements should have uncertainties! I believe this cut also removes some upper/lower limits (but don't quote me on that, yet)."

No! Fascinatingly, there are a bunch of stars (mostly in the `ps` tables) that have $log_{10}(L/L_\\odot)$ listed as exactly 1, regardless of reasonable radii and effective temperatures defined. Fortunately, most of those disappear when we filter out values that don't have uncertainties associated with them (= likely values from the TESS or Kepler input catalogs, one might wonder?). \n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are lots of stars that apparently have measurements (= existing uncertainties) of all three of $L, R, T_{eff}$ but yet have inconsistencies that amount to a factor of 2 in the inferred luminosity. It might be worth digging in a little more to see what sorts of systems they are and if there's anything we can do to improve the situation. In the meantime, we should probably be a smidge wary of exact stellar parameters!"

    "For planning future transit observations, we need to use a transit period, transit mid-point, and transit duration. If those three values come from different sources, it might potentially mess things up; it'd be good to check (a) how often if at all they come from the same reference, (b) what problems might emerge for prediciting transit events at the present day. Ideally, it would also be the case that (except maybe for extremely grazing transits) the quoted duration should be consistent with that calculated from the stellar and planetary properties; how often are transit durations actually quoted and how often are they right? \n",
