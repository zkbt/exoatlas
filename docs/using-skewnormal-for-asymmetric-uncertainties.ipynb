    "# Using Skew Normal Distributions for Asymmetric Uncertainties \n",
    "\n",
    "Many exoplanet parameters often have asymmetric errorbars, expressed as something like $$\\mu^{+\\sigma_{upper}}_{-\\sigma_{lower}}$$ where $\\mu$ is some estimate of central tendency, and the $\\sigma$s are the uncertainties. In `exoatlas`, we follow [Pineda et al. (2021)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...918...40P/abstract) to use *[skew normal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skew_normal_distribution)* distributions to approximate the probability distributions of table quantities with unequal upper and lower uncertainties. \n"

Behind the scenes, this interpolates from a table of skew normal coefficients depending on the ratio $\\sigma_{upper}/\\sigma_{lower}$, generates some samples, and renormalizes them to the requested $\\mu$, $\\sigma_{upper}$, and $\\sigma_{lower}$.
